# BlackjackPythonAI

Projekt f√ºr FH SWF

In this project I implemented monte carlo reinforced learning to teach a model to play blackjack.
It achieved a nearly optimal win rate of 43.11% (optimal Strategy "Basic Strategy" has 43.34% in my environment).

You can use this code for anything you want.
